Blogs litter the internet with business strategies, tips and templates to create a successful company. Lots of them will probably tell you more than I can, but I have an actual case study: my failed company.

The year was 2013, I just graduated from college and was overly confident in anything to do with hardware. I landed my first role as a hardware designer at a local company working on embedded systems.

I was working with a software engineer whos side-hustle was software for restaurants point of sale machines. Dozens of places in the area used his software. He approached me with an idea to build a table pager, patron hit the button, server shows up. The device would look better than existing products and would connect to phones, tablets or computers. We went out for dinner and I became interested, within a few months I cobbled together some hardware.

The tech was good, it used a low power radio and could last years on two AA batteries. My partner made nice a cross platform app and we were ready to get some feedback, which leads me into my first point.

## Don't Listen to your friends and family
They're not going to tell you it's a shit idea, even if it obviously is. People you love are a very good source positive encouragement when you're down, but not a good marketing point.

## Pay Money to Answer Questions
After we built a few devices we started getting volume quotes one the enclosure. It to the tune of $5000 for 1000 units ($5/unit), and a smaller quote of $1000 for 75 units ($13/unit). This was the first real money we would have spent on the product, and at 20 years old, $2500 would be a lot of cash for myself. We decided that $13 per unit was too expensive of a cost to pass on to our customer, so opted to purchase 1000 units.

## It's just like software
Developing software is one of the first trades that where you can create value without consuming raw materials. You can build to your hearts content and the only thing getting used up is time and electricity. Hardware development obviously isn't like this, so there's a mindset change when partnering with a software engineering.

## Start a company without a business person
The second step in failing in thinking that engineers are smarter than bisiness peopme. If you took some IQ against a busines person, you might win, however, IQ tests are simpley a good reason to prove you have autism. This isn't just a hardware company tip, but if you wanna fail I would exclude anyone in sales, marketing o rbusines.

## Assume people will buy because they said so
Cash is king, no one has bought your shit before they actually put money in your hand. We had nearly 15 places that wated to buy our shit, what was the conversion rate... lets than 0%.

## Dunk into the water

## Give away your shit
We got to a point where where we had not leads. We were sti

## Ignore your customers Revenue Stream
## Listen to your friends and family
Everyone loves you until the wallet comes out.

## Focus on BOM
