Blogs litter the internet with business strategies, tips, and templates for creating a successful company. Many of them will probably provide more insights than I can, but I have an actual case study: my failed company.

A decade ago, fresh out of college, I landed my first job as an "Electromechanical Technologist" and felt ready to conquer the world. Here's an image that describes where I was at back then.

I teamed up with a software engineer who had a successful side-hustle selling software for restaurants. Inspired by his work, we decided to venture into building and selling table pagers. Our device would outshine existing products, connecting seamlessly with phones, tablets, and computers. With no other side projects at the time, I eagerly joined the journey and quickly designed the hardware.

The technology was impressive it utilized low-power radio and could last for years on two AA batteries. My partner developed a great app, and we were eager to receive feedback, which leads me to my first point.

## Skip Market Research
We relied on the encouragement of friends and family, assuming they represented the entire market. Little did we realize that this approach had significant flaws. If we had conducted proper market research, we would have discovered these crucial insights:

  - Restaurant Owners: Typically financially strained.
  - Patrons: Not everyone feels comfortable using a pager.
  - Restaurant workers: resistant to changing their workflow.

Three major issues with our three customers, off to a good start. 

## Skip Market Testing
After building a few devices, we started receiving volume quotes for the enclosure. We were quoted $5,000 for 1,000 units ($5/unit) and a smaller quote of $1,000 for 75 units ($13/unit). This was our first significant expense, and as 20-year-olds, $2,500 seemed like a lot of cash.

At the time, we aimed for a sub-$10 bill of materials (BOM) target for the device. Focusing on margins so early on was one of our many mistakes. Since we skipped market research, our goal should have been to test the market. We needed to determine if people would actually buy the hardware, and the cost of conducting this test was either $1,000 or $5,000.

We chose to pay $5,000 to test the market.

## Don't Collect People's money
Excitement filled the air as we unpacked the 1,000 units in the basement of a restaurant. We had verbal orders from nearby establishments, but we made a crucial mistake: not collecting any deposits. When we delivered the hardware, one by one, excuses started pouring in. Without any financial commitment from customers, our orders meant nothing.

Nothing means anything until you have cash in hand.

## Try Selling Ice
At this point, we felt defeated. We were tired of looking at the basement filled with our unsold product, so we finally admitted that we needed a salesperson. We connected with a local sales guy who specialized in selling restaurant equipment. He had a reputation for being a smooth talker, claiming he could "sell ice to an Eskimo." With him onboard, we hoped that our luck would turn around.

Unfortunately, even with his sales expertise, he couldn't sell our product either. We found ourselves back at ground zero, feeling discouraged and uncertain about the future of our startup.

Even the best salesperson can't sell a flawed product.

## Don't Pivot
During one of my partner's visits to the physiotherapist, he happened to mention our venture. Intrigued, the physiotherapist became interested. He needed a system for his assistants to page him when patients were ready for inspection. On the spot, he purchased our system, with the condition that it came in a more reasonable enclosure.

At that point, we regretted spending $5,000 instead of the $1,000 option for enclosures. Nevertheless, we designed different enclosures and delivered them to our first real customer. Since he had offices all over the province, he expressed interest in buying more. Revisiting the initial customer analysis.

  - Physiotherapists: Typically financially well off.
  - Office workers: More inclined to change their workflow if it benefits everyone.

Our technology, with a mechanical modification worked perfectly for a different, better customer. 

## Finally
Despite the success of the pivot the project eventually fizzled out. By then, I had moved on to another job and was busy with travel, unable to support the electrical side of the business. I became disillusioned with the support required and pursued other exciting ventures. 

The project now sits in an undocumented, [open source repository](https://github.com/o7-machinehum/Pageup) with zero stars. I considered this experience a small loss but an invaluable learning opportunity, if I could go back in time I wouldn't change a think.
