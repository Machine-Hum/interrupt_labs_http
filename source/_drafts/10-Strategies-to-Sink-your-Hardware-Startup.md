Blogs litter the internet with business strategies, tips and templates to create a successful company. Lots of them will probably tell you more than I can, but I have an actual case study: my failed company.

A decade ago I was freshly out of college, I just lanted my first job as an "Electromechanical Technologist" and was ready to rule the world. Here's an image to describe where I was at.

I was working with a software engineer, his side-hustle was writing and selling software used in restaurants, mainly point of sale machines. Dozens of local restaraunts loved and used this software. One sunny day after work he approached me with an idea: to build and sell table pagers. The concept was simple, the patron hits the button, server shows up. The device would look better than existing products and would connect to phones, tablets or computers. At the time I didn't have any side hustles, so I jumped on board. I cobbled together some hardware within a few months.

The tech was good, it used a low power radio and could last years on two AA batteries. My partner made nice app and we were ready to get some feedback, which leads me into my first point.

## Skip Market Research
Don't Listen to your friends and family. They're not going to tell you it's a shit idea, even if it obviously is. People you love are a very good source positive encouragement when you're down, but not a good marketing point. You need to either hire a marketing specalist, or run the numbers yourself. We did neither, and just threw stuff at a wall to see what sticks. If we did the analasys we would quickly realised these things.

 - Our target customer, restaraunt owners, are typically broke.
 - There are cultural issues, not everyone feels comfortable using a pager.
 - Restaraunt workers don't want to chage their workflow.


## Skip Market Testing
After we built a few devices we started getting volume quotes one the enclosure. We were quoted $5000 for 1000 units ($5/unit), and a smaller quote of $1000 for 75 units ($13/unit). This the first big expense, and at 20 years old, $2500 was a lot of cash.

At the time, we had a sub 10$ BOM target for the device. This was one of our many mistakes, we were already focusing on margins. Since we skipped all the market research, our goal should have been to test the market. We needed to see if people would but the hardware, the cost of this was either $1000, or $5000.

We paid $5000 to test the market.


## Don't Collect People's money
We were working out of the basement of a restaurant at the time, the truck showed up with our 1000 units and dropped the pallet in the parking lot. We unpacked the shippment and were grinning cheak to cheak when we slide our boxes into the basement.

We assembled the units required to fill our several verbal "orders" from nearby restaurants. When we showed up with the hardwarer, one by one, excuses came out. This was of course naive of us, and when taking orders you take a deposit at minimum.


## Engineers are all you need
At this point we were pretty defeated, sick of looking at the basement filled with our product, nothing selling, we admitted we needed a sales person. We met up with a local sales guy that sold restaraunt equiptment. The guy was a used car salesman, he literially said he could "sell icecream to an Eskimo". With him onboard, our spirites were lifted thinking he might have better luck.

That didn't happen, he couldn't sell it ether. We were back to ground zero.


## Don't Think of Pivoting
My partner was getting his necked looked by his physiotherapist, during the examination he started talking about our venture. After seeing some pictures, the physiotherapist became intersted.
He needed a way for his assistants to page him when the patients were ready for their inspection. He end up buying a system on the spot, with the condition they came in a more reasonable enclosure.

At this point we really wished we spent $1000 instead of the $5000. We got some different enclosures made up and delivered to out first real customer. He had offices all over the Provence, so he was intersted in buying more. 


Unfortunately the project died out, but if we pivoted earlier then we might have been able to salvage things and made some cash back. I had moved to another job, I was busy traveling and couldn't support the electrical side anymore. I was jaded by the support needed and was off to more exciting ventures. I chocked this up to a small loss, and an amazing learning experience.
